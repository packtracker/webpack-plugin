This plugin is designed to upload your webpack build stats to the [packtracker.io](https://packtracker.io) service.

## Installation

Once you have your [project created](https://docs.packtracker.io/creating-your-first-project) on [packtracker.io](https://app.packtracker.io), and a `project_token` in hand, you can get your data flowing by installing and configuring this plugin.

```sh
npm install --save-dev @packtracker/webpack-plugin

```

## Usage


### Webpack Plugin

In your webpack configuration include the plugin (along with your project token).

> If the plugin fails to upload your stats, **it will not error out your build** but it will **log output signaling the failure**.

```js
const PacktrackerPlugin = require('@packtracker/webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new PacktrackerPlugin({
      project_token: '<your packtracker project token>',
      upload: true
    })
  ]
}
```

The `upload` option above tells the plugin whether or not to upload your build stats when running webpack. By default, this option is set to `false` to prevent accidental uploading from your local machine. If the upload option is left `false`, the plugin will do nothing.

 Once you see your stats are uploading, it is common to only upload when building your assets in a CI environment or during deployment. You can also omit this option altogether, and set the `PT_UPLOAD` environment variable on a per run basis to control the upload of your stats.

For example

```js
const PacktrackerPlugin = require('@packtracker/webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new PacktrackerPlugin({
      project_token: '<your packtracker project token>',
      upload: process.env.CI === 'true'
    })
  ]
}
```


### CLI

In addition to the primary use case of uploading as part of your build process via our webpack plugin, we also have a command line uploader that works well with tools like [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) that allow you to export your stats, but don't allow full plugin configuration.

The only caveat to using the CLI is that you **must** use environment variables to configure your stat reporting (most importantly `PT_PROJECT_TOKEN`).

#### Example with `create-react-app`

In your `package.json` you can add a run script like the following

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "packtracker": "react-scripts build --stats && packtracker-upload --stats=build/bundle-stats.json"
  }
}
```

The only additional parameter you can pass via the CLI is the `--output-path=<path to webpack output>`, if it is not passed we assume it is the directory that contains your bundle stats file.

Then running `npm run packtracker` should upload your stats to our service


### Options

All of the options, available to the plugin can be set [via argument to the plugin, environment variable, or allowed to query your local git repository.](https://github.com/packtracker/webpack-plugin/blob/master/config.js)

Here is a listing of the plugin options, environment variable counterparts, and a description.

| Option          | Env Variable       | Description
|---------------- |--------------------|------------
|`project_token`  | `PT_PROJECT_TOKEN` | The project token for your packtracker.io project (required)
|`fail_build`     | `PT_FAIL_BUILD`    | Fail the build if the stat upload fails (default: `false`)
|`branch`         | `PT_BRANCH`        | Branch of the commit <br> (default: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`)
|`author`         | `PT_AUTHOR`        | Committer's email (default: `git log --format="%aE" -n 1 HEAD`)
|`message`        | `PT_MESSAGE`       | The commit message (default: `git log --format="%B" -n 1 HEAD`)
|`commit`         | `PT_COMMIT`        | The commit sha (default: `git rev-parse HEAD`)
|`committed_at`   | `PT_COMMITTED_AT`  | Unix timestamp (ms) of the commit <br> (default: `git log --format="%ct" -n 1 HEAD`)
|`prior_commit`   | `PT_PRIOR_COMMIT`  | The previous commit sha (default: `git rev-parse HEAD^`)
|`ci_server`      | `PT_CI_SERVER`     | One of `circleci`, `codeship`, `jenkins`, `sephamore`, or `travis`
|`exclude_assets` | --                 | Mirrors the [excludeAssets configuration in the webpack stats config](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/stats/#stats) (only available to webpack version 3.5.0+)
